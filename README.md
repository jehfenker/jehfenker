I am a postdoctoral researcher fellow in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Michigan, at Lacey Knowlesâ€™ lab. I am currently living in Australia,
where I completed my Ph.D. at the Australian National University, at Craig Moritzâ€™s lab.

Most of my research investigates the evolutionary, ecological, morphological and biogeographic 
patterns that generate biodiversity, going from micro to macroevolution, mainly using reptiles as a research model.

I am a proud member of two Brazilian women in STEM initiatives, <a href="https://herpeto2herpetologas.wixsite.com/-h2h"> H2H (Herpetologia segundo herpetÃ³logas)</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kunhaase/?hl=en"> Rede KunhÃ£ AsÃ© </a>,
aiming to promote equity and value the role of Women in Science.
