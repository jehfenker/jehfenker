I am currently working at the Atlas of Living Australia (CSIRO), a collaborative, digital, 
open infrastructure that pulls together Australian biodiversity data from multiple sources, 
making it accessible and reusable. I work in partnership with EcoCommons, a platform for digital 
modelling and analysis needs on ecological and environmental research, currently in construction. 👩🏽‍💻

I am also currently associated with the Australian National University (ANU), collaborating with the 
Moritz and Cardillo labs. 🧬

I completed a postdoctoral in the department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology
at the University of Michigan, at Lacey Knowles’ lab. I am currently living in Australia,
where I completed my Ph.D. at the Australian National University, at Craig Moritz’s lab. 👩🏻‍🔬

Most of my research investigates the evolutionary, ecological, morphological and biogeographic 
patterns that generate biodiversity, going from micro to macroevolution, mainly using reptiles as a research model. 🦎

I am a proud member of two Brazilian women in STEM initiatives, <a href="https://herpeto2herpetologas.wixsite.com/-h2h"> H2H (Herpetologia segundo herpetólogas)</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/kunhaase/?hl=en"> Rede Kunhã Asé </a>,
aiming to promote equity and value the role of Women in Science. 💪
